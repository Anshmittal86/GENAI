Hi Piyush,
I have completed the Docker Development course from learn.piyushgarg.dev, which I had enrolled in for â‚¹1499. However, I have not received the course completion certificate yet.
I have been trying to connect with you regarding this, but I havenâ€™t received any response. Hence, I am posting my comment here. Please look into this and share the course completion certificate with me at the earliest.
Looking forward to your response.

Ans: Hey Shahid - Glad that you reached here. If you want I can email you the certificate but as there is no examination in this course, The certificate doesnâ€™t carry any value ðŸ˜€. But feel free to reply and I will email the certificate for same.
